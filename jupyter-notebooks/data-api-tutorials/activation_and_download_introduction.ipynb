    "## Item Asset Activation and Download\n",
    "In order to download imagery assets, they must first be activated. Once active, the asset may be downloaded using the provided link.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Full resolution uncompressed satellite images are big and there are lots of ways to view them.\n",
    " * For this reason Planet generally keeps images in their native format and only processes them on customer requests.\n",
    " * All images must be activated prior to downloading and this can take some time based on demand.\n",
    " * Generally speaking there are three kinds of scenes:\n",
    "    * Analytic - multi-band full resolution images that have not been processed. These are like raw files for DSLR camers.\n",
    "    * Visual - these are color corrected rectified tifs. If you are just starting out this is your best call.\n",
    "    * UDM - Usable data mask. This mask can be used to find bad pixels and columns and to mask out areas with clouds."
